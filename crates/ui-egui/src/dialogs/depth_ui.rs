//! Estimate Depth: the Surface popover's button.
//!
//! The estimate runs `image.estimateDepth`, which uses the shared Craft AI layer's `estimate-depth`
//! tool. When the tool is not set up, [`native`] draws the shared layer's own screens over its
//! state (the missing-model popup, then `craft_ai_egui::native_model_setup` over a `SetupSession`),
//! so setup, the download and the consent to it are the shared flow, not a second one here.
//! Everything that reads or writes disk or the network runs on a worker thread. The web build has
//! no AI layer: the button is disabled there.
